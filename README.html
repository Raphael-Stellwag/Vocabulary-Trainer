<h2 id="the-sync-process">The sync process</h2>
<h3 id="definition-of-action">Definition of Action</h3>
<p>An Action in the context of this project is a modify operation (Insert, Update or Delete) forced by the user on a device. This action then must be synced through the several devices the user may have.</p>
<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
<ol>
<li>We get the server Actions from the Rest Service (just the actions since the last sync --&gt; so just the actions from other devices)</li>
<li>We undo the local Actions (newest to oldest)</li>
<li>We perform the server Actions</li>
<li>For Version 2: Performance Improvements --&gt; we perform not all actions (e.g. 2 Update Actions on 1 Vocabulary --&gt; just the 2. Update is done, the first is discarded)</li>
<li>We redo the local Actions (maybe not all actions can be done, e.g. the server Action deleted a Vocabulary. After this an update of course not works anymore. These actions are discarded)</li>
<li>We publish the local Actions to the server</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenges--rules">Challenges &amp; Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>Through the server Actions, the deleted and then readded Vocabularies (local Actions with the method &quot;ADD&quot;) will have another Id after the insert --&gt; if afterwards an update on this vocabulary is done, the id there must also be changed, that the action is performed on the correct Vocabulary.</li>
<li>Through the server Actions, a vocabulary could be deleted --&gt; The Update must be discarded</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
